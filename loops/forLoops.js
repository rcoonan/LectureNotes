/*
-Loops offer us a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly, or loop over something.
-There are many kinds of loops, but they all roughly do the same thing.
    -It will repeat until a specified condition evaluates to true.
        -For statement
        -do while statement
        -while statement
        -labeled statement
        -break statement
        -for in statement
        -for of statement

Note: there is a danger of infinite loops. There are three main parts to a loop:
    -initial expression
    -condition
    -increment expression
